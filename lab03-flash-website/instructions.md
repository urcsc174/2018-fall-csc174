# Assignment 3: "Flash" Website
*Due: <s>Monday, September 17, 2018 (today)</s> Monday, September 24, 2018*

**The goal** of this assignment is to work as a team to combine three students' initial personal websites into one cohesive website during the time allotted.

**The purpose** of this assignment is to demonstrate how working with a team of web developers is better than working alone.

- [ ] There must be **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements from each webpage to external "include" files
