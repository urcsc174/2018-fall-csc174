# In-class exercise 0: Introductions and Prep
*Due: Wednesday, August 29 (today)*

## Class Check-in

- [ ] In Blackboard, in the *Lecture Check-in* area, check-in to today's class

## Introductions in Slack


- [ ] Create an account in our **CSC 174 Slack Workspace**
- [ ] Find and join the **#chatter** channel, and create a post

  - [ ] Introduce yourself: 
    - Name
    - Major
    - Expected graduation
    - Other affiliation or interesting fact about yourself (optional)
  - [ ] Rate yourself (or list your accomplishments); in regard to:

    - Organizational skills (are you a very organized person or a flexible/creative person ...or both?)
    - Graphic design skills
    - Technical skills and/or programming abilities

Note: it's important to share information about yourself in Slack because you will need this information when you form groups to work on projects in CSC 174.


## For Next Week

For next class, **have content prepared** to create a quick webpage that we'll mess around with later.  (You only need the content ready to go.  We'll work on putting it together next week.)

## Requirements

- [ ] Your name, your major, basic information about yourself you want to share
- [ ] A digital photo of yourself (or a photo that represents something you like)
- [ ] At least 500 words about the following
  - Job(s) you've held, if any (can be anything: work-study; internships; co-ops; et cetera)
  - Courses you're taking or have taken ...or pretty much anything about your academic career
  - Other things about you (or information about your country/area of origin; or anything else you would like to share)
- [ ] Write the content in four distinct sections 
  - [ ] Suggestion: create the four sections as paragraphs - at least four but can be more; each one should be between 75 and 150 words or so
  - [ ] Suggestion: write it like a story - can be a timeline; or some kind of progression (beginning, middle, end); or some other logical sequence (e.g. courses you've taken grouped by easiest, harder, hardest)
  - [ ] Do *not* create lists, headings, or other types of elements - just sentences arranged in paragraphs
  - [ ] Keep the image (the photo of yourself) as a separate file - do *not* embed it in your document

Look at [the professor's example (ZIP)](media/example.zip) to get a feel for what's required.  Notice, in the Word document there are no headings nor lists.  It's just plain text.  And notice the image file is not web-ready - it's way too large.  (That's okay.  We'll fix that next week.)
