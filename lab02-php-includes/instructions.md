# Assignment 2: PHP Includes
*Due: Wednesday, September 12, 2018*

The goal of this assignment is to re-factor the content in your Initial Personal Website (lab 1) so it uses PHP Includes appropriately

# Requirements


- [ ] Use **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements from your four page website and put them in external "include" files.
- [ ] The navigation element must **indicate which is the current page** which means you'll have to use a PHP or JS solution to insert the a *class* on the appropriate menu item.
- [ ] The HTML, CSS and JS code, files and file system must be clean and follow **industry best practices and standards**

## Installation

- [ ] The website must be installed on the class web server with a folder name in the pattern of first-initial, last name, e.g. **rkostin**, (or you can make it the same as your URID), and put your website in there


### Web Server Credentials

Everyone will use the same FTP account in this class so be careful when you're working on the web server!  Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files.

FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment02@csc174.org
FTP Password: coffee1N/!18
