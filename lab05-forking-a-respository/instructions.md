# Lab 5: Forking a Repository

*Due: Monday, October 1, 2018 (one week)* 

The goal of this lab assignment is to Fork another team's website and make it better.  Also, this lab assignment tests the IA's ability to re-arrange content into a meaningful Information Architecture.

## Requirements

This lab assignment assumes all the requirements from the previous team lab, Lab 3.  I.e. the new website must conform to Lab 3's requirements as well as these new ones below.

- [ ] Each city-team member must **perform a different role** than they did on Lab 3.
- [ ] Each city-team must use another team's website as a basis (in **Github: "Fork"**)
- [ ] **The IA:** must apply a proper information architecture to the website
  - There must be a clear and understandable **ontology**, **taxonomy**, and **choreography** to the content
  - There must be a **readme.md** file in the city-team's repository; the readme must include: 
    - The **city-team's name** 
    - **Who worked** on the website and **the role** each person performed (IA, Designer, Coder)
  - Also, the readme must describe the **ontology** (the domain and how it's represented); the **taxonomy** (how the content is arranged and referenced); and the **choreography** (the rationale behind the order of things)
- [ ] **The designer:** must apply a **new design** to the website, i.e., rip-out the existing CSS as start over with a new one
  - Note: the designer can use a different site's CSS as a basis, including one they wrote themselves
- [ ] **The coder:** must maintain standards, making sure...
  - The PHP Includes factor out redundant code (within reason)
  - The current page highlighter works
  - All HTML and CSS meet W3C standards (within reason)
  - The source code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and/or PHP) is properly formatted with whitespace and readable
  - The website is mounted on the class webserver and works correctly
