# Assignment 1: Initial Personal Website
*Due: Monday, September 10, 2018*

The goal of this assignment is to simply apply a lot of the basic skills you learned in CSC 170. 

# Requirements


- [ ] Create **a styled, four page website** using the information, previously gathered about yourself.
  - [ ] The HTML must be **semantically correct**, **properly structured**, and **valid** according to the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
  - [ ] The CSS must exist in an **externally linked stylesheet** and set some basic formatting **embellishments** (fonts, colors, layout), and the CSS must be **valid** according to the to the [W3C CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
    - Note: there will be a subjective aspect to the rubric - it must look like you made an attempt to make the website look interesting (even if it looks terrible; we'll work on that later this semester)
    - Hint: you don't have much content; try using large fonts
  - [ ] All pages must look like they belong together, using common elements that look and work as expected (for example, a common header and common navigation element)

### PHP Includes and the Website Navigation Element

- [ ] The website must use **PHP Includes** to factor-out common elements, e.g. the navigation element
  - Hint: you can start with plain HTML files with duplicate content (headers and footers) and factor out the duplicate content later
- [ ] The navigation element must **indicate which is the current page**
  - Don't forget: because the navigation will be in a PHP Include, you need to use a solution to insert the *is-current* class (or whatever you're using) on the appropriate navigation element.  You can look-up any solution you want, or just you the JavaScript I provided back in CSC 170 [linked in a ZIP file, here](menu-highlighter.js.zip)
- [ ] The files and file system must be clean and follow industry best practices
  - [ ] No unused files
  - [ ] Files of certain types (e.g. images, CSS, includes) must be properly sorted into sub-directories
  - [ ] Folder names and filenames must be logical and make sense for what they contain (and one of the files must be named: **index**)
  - [ ] Image files must be properly optimized and appropriately sized for the web

## Installation

- [ ] The website must be installed on the class web server with a folder name in the pattern of first-initial, last name, e.g. **rkostin**, (or you can make it the same as your URID), and put your website in there


### Web Server Credentials

Everyone will use the same FTP account in this class so be careful when you're working on the web server!  Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment01@csc174.org
FTP Password: coffee1N/!18
```
