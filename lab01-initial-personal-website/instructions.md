    - Note: there will be a subjective aspect to the rubric - it must look like you made an attempt to make the website look interesting (even if it looks terrible; we'll work on that later this semester)
    - Hint: you don't have much content; try using large fonts

- [ ] The navigation element must **indicate which is the current page**

  - [ ] No unused files
  - [ ] Files of certain types (e.g. images, CSS, includes) must be properly sorted into sub-directories
  - [ ] Folder names and filenames must be logical and make sense for what they contain (and one of the files must be named: **index**)
  - [ ] Image files must be properly optimized and appropriately sized for the web

## Installation

- [ ] The website must be installed on the class web server with a folder name in the pattern of first-initial, last name, e.g. **rkostin**, (or you can make it the same as your URID), and put your website in there
