# In-class exercise 1: Introduction to Slack
*Due: Thursday, August 30 (today)*

# Requirements


- [ ] Your assignment is to login to the CSC 174 Slack Workspace and **create a post** in the **#chatter** channel:
  - Introduce yourself  - name, major, anticipated graduation date
  - Make a music suggestion: a song or band/artist that would make a good "seed" for the professor's Pandora app (no angry music please!)
   - Also, **add a reaction** (like a thumbs-up) to other students' music suggestions - in effect, vote for good suggestions

- [ ] Also, say *Hi* to at least three other students by clicking the **Reply to Thread** button and then say something nice.

That's it for today.

# For Next Week

For next class, **have content prepared** to create a quick webpage that we'll mess around with later.  (You only need the content ready to go.  We'll work on putting it together next week.)

## Requirements

- [ ] Your name, your major, basic information about yourself you want to share
- [ ] A digital photo of yourself (or a photo that represents something you like)
- [ ] At least 500 words about the following
  - Job(s) you've held, if any (can be anything: work-study; internships; co-ops; et cetera)
  - Courses you're taking or have taken ...or pretty much anything about your academic career
  - Other things about you (or information about your country/area of origin; or anything else you would like to share)
- [ ] Write the content in four distinct sections 
  - [ ] Suggestion: create the four sections as paragraphs - at least four but can be more; each one should be between 75 and 150 words or so
  - [ ] Suggestion: write it like a story - can be a timeline; or some kind of progression (beginning, middle, end); or some other logical sequence (e.g. courses you've taken grouped by easiest, harder, hardest)
  - [ ] Do *not* create lists, headings, or other types of elements - just sentences arranged in paragraphs
  - [ ] Keep the image (the photo of yourself) as a separate file - do *not* embed it in your document

Look at [the professor's example (ZIP)](media/example.zip) to get a feel for what's required.  Notice, in the Word document there are no headings nor lists.  It's just plain text.  And notice the image file is not web-ready - it's way too large.  (That's okay.  We'll fix that next week.)
