# Lab 6: CSS Architecture

*Due: Wednesday, October 3, 2018* 

The goal of this exercise is to practice arranging CSS into a useful structure (architecture).

NOTE: this is an individual assignment.  Everyone turns-in their own work.

## Prep

Download and unzip the CSS file: [lab06.zip](lab06.zip)

## Requirements

The provided CSS file has about 170 styles on 1,180 lines.  Each style is in alphabetical order, which is not useful.  

- [ ] Edit the file **lab06.css** - apply a CSS architecture.  Use any published technique or invent your own.  
- [ ] The CSS must continue to pass [the W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- [ ] At the top of the CSS file, in comments, write the following:
  - Your name
  - The CSS organization technique(s) you used.  Or if you made your own variation of a technique then describe it.
  - Provide an outline of the CSS structure - the order of things, from a high-level ...like a table of contents

Note: you can re-arrange the contents of this one file.  You can break the contents into multiple files.  It's up to you, but whatever you do needs to make sense from a CSS management standpoint.

## Submit the Assignment

To get credit for your work, upload your CSS file(s) to Blackboard, in the assignment: **Assignment 6: CSS Architecture**
