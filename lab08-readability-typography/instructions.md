# Lab 8: Readability and Typography

*Due: Wednesday, October 10, 2018* 

In this exercise you will take existing content and demonstrate your ability to increase readability and legibility by applying the design principles covered in class. 

This is an **individual assignment**.  You will not be working as a team on this one.

## Step 1: Copy Lab 2

- [ ] Make a copy of your Lab 2 files (The "PHP Includes" assignment)
  - If there were any references to "Lab 2", change them to "Lab 8"
  - If there were any deficiencies in Lab 2, fix them else you're liable to loose points for the same errors.
- [ ] In an appropriate place in your content, provide a link back to your Assignment 2 website.

*Note: layout is not a focus of this assignment.  If Lab 2 had deficiencies in the layout you should fix them.  However, for Lab 8 you are not required to apply a Z- or F-pattern.*

## Step 2: Improve the Website

The key to this exercise is to *not* randomly apply styles like we did in CSC 170, rather use reasons and a rationale to apply just the right styles in just the right ways to make the webpage more legible and readable.  

### Requirements

Using CSS, you need to make these improvements.

- [ ] Improve the legibility and readability of this webpage using CSS
- [ ] Install two custom fonts
  - Beware!  Make sure the fonts pair well and actually make sense considering the content
  - Focus on legibility and readability
- [ ] Apply styles to improve the design, focusing on the CRAP principles

#### Document your Decisions

- [ ] As you complete the requirements above, you need to: **write comments in the CSS file that explain the rationale for each set of styles you write.**  
  - Relate each style to the things we covered in class having to do with typography and readability.  
  - Explain not just what you did, but **why**

Examples:

- explain the typefaces you chose...

```css
/* I picked these typefaces, monsarrat and finociario, because 
   they portray a mood of... (and so on) */
```


- explain styles that improves readability...

```css
/* I added padding to these elements to move the content away 
   from the border, increasing readability of the section... 
   (and so on) */
```

*Note: it's never a good idea to choose a typeface based on its name alone. Also never say that you chose a typeface or style because you "like it."*

## Step 3: Submit the Assignment

- [ ] The website must be installed on the class web server with a folder name in the pattern of first-initial, last name, e.g. **rkostin**, (or you can make it the same as your URID), and put your website in there
  - Note: the root of the website needs to be the folder you create.  (e.g. **rkostin**)  Do not put the website within another sub-folder within the root.  I.e. do not create an "lab08" folder.

### Web Server Credentials

Everyone will use the same FTP account in this class so be careful when you're working on the web server!  Be careful *not* to disturb other students' files.

```
FTP Server (a.k.a. Hostname): ftp.csc174.org
FTP Port: 21
FTP Username: assignment08@csc174.org
FTP Password: [removed - DM the prof if you need it again]
```

*Notice that the username is different from last time*

## Submit the Assignment

To get credit for your work, submit a link to your website in Blackboard, in the assignment: **Assignment 8: Readability and Typography**

*Note: this time there are no other requirements regarding submissions in Blackboard.  Just provide the link.*
